#OrganizEZ
Created to easily organize your files using Machine Learning utilized through IBM Watson's APIs.

The program takes your files as input and sends its contents to IBM Watson. IBM Watson returns with a JSON of it's analysis including the content's relevance, attitude, and even main themes. OrganizEZ then places that file into its appropriate folder while notifying you of its action. Through the GUI, you can see all the files that have been moved as well as search through them. In the future, we hope to add thumbs up and thumbs down functionality and send IBM Watson positive and negative feedback so it learns about the user's tastes.
